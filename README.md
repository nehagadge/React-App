# RoboFriends

RoboFriends is a React app that lets you search between different API generated robots by name. It's fully responsive and functional in different screen sizes.

This app integrates with a robot's API to fetch random robot images by searching them and display them on the website.

This project is based on a tutorial project called Robofriends from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course: The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery. It's a wonderful course and I highly recommend it!
This project is created using React, and utlizes the Robohash and JSONPlaceholder APIs to create a series of contact cards with unique robot avatars for a sample list of contacts/friends. Additionally, the Tachyons CSS toolkit is used for quick styling. The application featured contact cards that displayed the contact's name and email, as well as an avatar. The project includes a search field that filters the displayed contacts based on names, through the search field.
